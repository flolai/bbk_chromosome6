======================

This directory contains only the HTML files.

### Index page and Navigation

This is the front page of the genome browser. At the top there is a navigation bar, this helps you navigate through the browser.
Navigation bar includes:
* **Home**
* **Search**
* **Gene summary**

### Search HTML page

This is search HTML page of the genome browser. The navigation at the top helps you user to navigate through the browser. You can search by:
* **Gene Identifier**
* **Chromosomal location**
* **Protein Product**
* **GenBank Accession**

As GenBank Accession is unique only one entry will be returned in the table format, whereas the others can return one or more in a table.

* One entry returned when GenBank Accession used to search:

### Gene summary page

This is the gene summary page, where the all of the genes in chromosome 6 are in a table.
By selecting a GenBank Accession hyperlink, you will be taken to the detail page

### Detail page

This is the detail page of the gene when you select GenBank Accession hyperlink; either when you search it and a table is displayed or when you click on the gene summary page and all the genes in Chromosome 6 are displayed in a table.

Detail page includes:
* **GenBank Accession**
* **Gene Identifier**
* **Protein Product**
* **Amino Acid sequence**
* **Chromosomal Location**
* **Coding region-CDS**
* **DNA sequence-with coding regions highlighted
* **Dropdown menu to search where the restriction enzyme cuts, a star or stars are used to indicated this on the DNA Sequence**
* **Codon usage frequencies in the chosen gene and in Chromosome 6**
